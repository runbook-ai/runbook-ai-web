Go to www.craigslist.org, and search for "Honda Civic" in the "for sale" section. Filter the results to show only listings with prices between $8000 and $10000. Sort the listings by date and get the last 3 days' results. Cap at 5 listings.

Run sub-task for each listing: Click the listing on the results page to view the details, and store the url, price, vin number and image. Close the listing page.

Finally, generate an HTML table summarizing all listings with columns for title (link to postUrl), price, vin, and image.
